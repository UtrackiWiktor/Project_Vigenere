# Vigenere

Console program, able to encrypt plaintext with Vigenere Cipher using user-provided kay as well as decode encrypted message - with or without providing encryption key. Deciphering without key is not fully automated process and requires user to make some decisions choosing the most probable key - this of course requires user to have at least a basic knowledge about cryptanalysis of polyalphabetic ciphers to make a guess what key lenght is the most likely (given results of statistical analysis) and later choose which of the several proposed keys is correct. I did not fully automate the process for there was not enough time and it was not the main goal of the project, so I left it semi-automated maybe to finish it in the future :)
