Darth Plagueis is first mentioned in the 2005 Star Wars prequel film Revenge of the Sith, during the opera scene. Darth Sidious, under his alternate persona of Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, tells Anakin Skywalker about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "The Wise". Palpatine explains that Plagueis could prevent people from dying and "create life" through a special Sith power of The Force, unknown to the Jedi. Despite being able to prevent others from dying, Plagueis is killed in his sleep by his own apprentice.[1] Later in the film, Palpatine as Sidious tempts Anakin to the dark side by promising to use this power to prevent Anakin's pregnant wife Padmé Amidala from dying, as Anakin has foreseen.
